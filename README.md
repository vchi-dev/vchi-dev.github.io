## Vincent's Portfolio Website
Hi there! 👋 This is my portfolio website.\
You can visit it at: vchi-dev.github.io
\
This website was built from scratch with my sense of design. Feel free to leave feedback or suggestions on my email.\

### Important: Please do not copy, reuse, or redistribute my code or design elements. I worked very hard putting all of this together and I want it to be recognized that this is my work.
If you have questions or concerns, feel free to contact me at my email.\
My Email: vchi.dev@proto.me

Thank You (● ◡ ●)
